Final answers
-------------

#. Calculate the average annual deforestation rate overall (%/year) and per capita (ft\ :sup:`2`/year/capita) for all the counties in Georgia from 2001 and 2019.

   * Calculated in the forestrate0119 and forestratecap0119 columns in ga_counties.
   * Negative values indicate deforestation while positive reforestation.

#. Find which county has lost the most forest overall (%/year) and per capita (ft\ :sup:`2`/year/capita).

   * The worst overall county is Gwinnett.
   * The worst per-capita county is Clinch.

#. Find which county has lost the least or gained the most forest overall (%/year) and per capita (ft\ :sup:`2`/year/capita).

   * The best overall county is Terrell.
   * The best per-capita county is Lincoln.

#. Calculate the statewide annual average deforestation rate in percentage (%/year) and per capita (ft\ :sup:`2`/year/capita).

   * The statewide annual average deforestation rate is 0.28%/year.
   * The statewide annual average deforestation rate per capita is 213 ft\ :sup:`2`/year/capita.

#. Finally, report how many and percentage of counties are worse than the two statewide average rates.

   * Total 73 counties (45.9%) are worse than the statewide average deforestation rate.
   * Total 74 counties (46.5%) are worse than the statewide average deforestation rate per capita.

Future considerations
---------------------

Consider spatial forest disturbances induced by human activities.
