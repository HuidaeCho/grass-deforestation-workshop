This workshop will give you an introduction of the Geographic Resources Analysis Support System (`GRASS <https://grass.osgeo.org/>`_) Geographic Information System (GIS) and its brief history.
We will define an objective for our deforestation study and install the latest daily build of GRASS 8 for Windows.
You will learn its basic data structure and how to answer those questions in the objective using GRASS.
