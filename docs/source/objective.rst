Objective
=========

We want to study deforestation in the state of Georgia.
Our objective is to

#. Calculate the average annual deforestation rate overall (%/year) and per capita (ft\ :sup:`2`/year/capita) for all the counties in Georgia from 2001 and 2019.
#. Find which county has lost the most forest overall (%/year) and per capita (ft\ :sup:`2`/year/capita).
#. Find which county has lost the least or gained the most forest overall (%/year) and per capita (ft\ :sup:`2`/year/capita).
#. Calculate the statewide annual average deforestation rate in percentage (%/year) and per capita (ft\ :sup:`2`/year/capita).
#. Finally, report how many and percentage of counties are worse than the two statewide average rates.
