Introduction
============

GRASS GIS
---------
`GRASS GIS <https://grass.osgeo.org/>`_ is an open-source GIS with over 500 modules, most of which provide advanced spatial analysis and modeling capabilities using raster, vector, 3 dimensional (3D), and temporal formats.
Its scientific modules are often used as plugins to other systems.
For example, `QGIS <https://qgis.org/>`_, another open-source GIS, implements a processing provider system that can borrow third-party GIS modules such as GRASS GIS and `SAGA GIS <https://saga-gis.sourceforge.io/>`_.
You may already be using GRASS modules when using QGIS!
